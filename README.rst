Python bindings to the Ceilometer API
=====================================

This is a client library for Ceilometer built on the Ceilometer API. It
provides a Python API (the ``ceilometerclient`` module) and a command-line tool
(``ceilometer``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the
`developer guide <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html>`_.  The master
repository is in `Git <http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/python-ceilometerclient>`_.

See release notes and more at `<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-ceilometerclient/>`_.
